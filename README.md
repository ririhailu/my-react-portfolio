# My-react-portfolio

## Description

This assignment allows me to put out my collective works I have done to the community. This process can help me get the exposure I need for future job prospects. I have included six of my works I have completed to exhibit my skills as a web developer. I used react to enhance my portfolio.


## Installation

The my-react-portfolio was initially created in a repository in GitHub. The repository was cloned into a local desktop. All changes were added, committed, and pushed to the repository. This project used react skills to enhance the portfolio. This project was deployed to GitHub Pages.
